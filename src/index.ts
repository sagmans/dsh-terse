/**
 * dsh-terse — mandatory, always-on terseness for DeepSeek Harness agents.
 *
 * The plugin compresses everything the agent *emits* and everything it *reads*,
 * without touching the deployment's own system prompt: it contributes sections
 * and context and lets the prompt registry compose, exactly as DeepSeek's own
 * first-party rows do. There is no mode and no off switch; mounting the row is
 * the enabling act.
 *
 * Six layers, each mapped to one harness extension point:
 *
 * - L1 constitution   -> `systemPrompt.section` (static, cache-stable)
 * - L2 standing       -> `systemPrompt.context` (durable snapshot, survives compaction)
 * - L3 nudge + drift  -> `tools/post-execute` `additionalContexts` (rides a result)
 * - L4 input shaping  -> `tools/post-execute` content replacement (reversible)
 * - L5 enforcement    -> `system-prompt/assemble` (observe + log, never rewrite peers)
 * - L6 coverage       -> per-session state keyed by the session object
 *
 * @module dsh-terse
